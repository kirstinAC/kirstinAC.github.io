			<h1>Housing Information</h1>

			<p>Visit <a href="https://offcampus.housing.artcenter.edu" target="_blank">https://offcampus.housing.artcenter.edu</a> and sign up as 'Guest' (temporary password: accdhousing) to create a roommate profile if you would like to connect with other students looking for a roommate.</p>

			<h2>Universal Student Housing Services</h2>
			<p>ArtCenter also partners with the Universal Student Housing Services (<a href="http://www.ushstudent.com/" target="_blank">http://www.ushstudent.com/</a>), which offers international and out-of-state students affordable housing in the homes of approved local families and individuals.</p>

			<h2>Bulletin Board</h2>
			<p>There are physical advertisements posted on the 'Housing Resources' bulletin board at the Hillside Campus, as well as an Off-Campus Housing Facebook group that advertises room/house shares and apartments for rent. Feel free to connect here for access: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ACCDHousing" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/ACCDHousing</a>.</p>

			<h2>IHPS Homestay</h2>
			<p>ArtCenter has recently started a partnership with International Housing Placement Service (IHPS), a home-stay resource. IHPS provides housing placement with local residents for out-of-state and international students enrolled in various ArtCenter programs. In-state students may also apply for housing using IHPS. Please be clear if the student is under age 18. To apply go to <a href="http://www.ihpshomestays.com" target="_blank">www.ihpshomestays.com</a>, or call 626-798-0209. *IHPS is a program endorsed by ArtCenter, but is not a function of the college.</p>

			<p>Note: ArtCenter does not investigate the quality or safety of the housing options available, nor does it involve itself in disputes between landlords and students.</p>
