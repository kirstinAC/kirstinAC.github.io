			<h1>Policies &amp; Procedures</h1>

			<p>The ACN Student Guide is a complete guide to ACN's policies, procedures and important information. Copies are available in the Public Programs office.</p>

			<h2>Dismissal Policy</h2>

			<p>At its sole discretion, ArtCenter at Night reserves the right to dismiss or refuse enrollment to any student whose conduct fails to comply with the policies, rules and standards of the College. Please see pages 24&ndash;31 of the 2016 ACN Student Guide for details.</p>
			<p>ArtCenter at Night (ACN) also reserves the right to refuse enrollment to any student who owes a past due balance to ArtCenter at Night or ArtCenter College of Design.</p>

			<h2>Academic Honesty Policy</h2>
			<p>We assume that ArtCenter students have a basic understanding of the principles of academic honesty. However, the following guidelines should assist students in clarifying behaviors that are not acceptable to the ArtCenter community.

			<p>1. Plagiarism occurs when another person's ideas, language or image is borrowed or stolen and is not properly acknowledged. When presenting written materials, words of another must be placed within quotation marks and a reference to the source provided. If material is paraphrased or restated in the student's words, a reference to the source must also be provided.</p>

			<p>2. We assume that artists and designers commonly draw on other artists' work for reference and inspiration or to make a commentary on that artist's work. We encourage this type of exploration. However, there is fine line between "drawing inspiration" from a piece and making a literal copy. When a student represents a literal copy of another artist's work as his or her own, this is considered plagiarism.</p>

			<p>3. Cheating is defined as accepting or giving aid to another during a written exam or for a written report unless authorized by the instructor or accepting or giving aid to another for an individual studio project unless authorized by the instructor. This includes representing another person's work as one's own or buying or selling written or visual work to be turned in for a class. Students may not submit the same work for more than one assignment without the written permission of BOTH instructors.</p>

			<p>4. No students may disclose or exploit the ideas of another without that student's express written permission.</p>

			<p>ArtCenter will deal with violations of these academic honesty codes on an individual basis. A committee comprised of faculty and administrators will listen to all cases. If the group is convinced of the individual's intention to deceive, the student may be suspended or dismissed.</p>

			<h2>Equal Opportunity</h2>
			<p>ArtCenter College of Design is committed to providing equal opportunity for all, without regard to race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, age or handicap.</p>
