			<h1>Scholarships</h1>

			<p>Through the continuing support and generosity of numerous organizations and individuals, ACN is pleased to offer a limited number of scholarships to deserving students based on financial need.</p>

			<h2>ACN general scholarships</h2>
			<p>These scholarships are intended for students who have a strong desire to pursue a career in an art or design and are preparing to submit portfolios for admission to one of ArtCenter’s full-time degree programs. Awards are based on the applicant’s financial need, a written personal statement, samples of a artwork and available scholarship funds. ACN scholarships cover tuition for one ACN course, plus a supply stipend of $75. Scholarship recipients may be asked to show a copy of their federal income tax return for verification. For an application and guidelines, please see below.</p>
