			<h1>Student Support Services</h1>

			<p>ArtCenter at Night coordinates assistance regarding reasonable accommodations for ACN students with disabilities and ensures disability law compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and state and local requirements regarding students and applicants with disabilities. Under these laws, no otherwise qualified individual with a disability shall be denied access to or participation in the services, programs and activities of the College.</p>

			<p>New ACN students who require disability-related accommodations are encouraged to contact the Director, ArtCenter at Night during the registration period, at least two weeks before the start of the term.
