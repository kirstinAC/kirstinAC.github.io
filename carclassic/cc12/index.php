<meta name="description" content="Join top transportation designers, car collectors and auto enthusiasts of all stripes at Art Center College of Designâ€™s Car Classic 2012. This fall we celebrate the vehicles that make our heart race, the nostalgia we feel for the cars of our youth and the deep loyalty we have to transportation in all its myriad forms. We'll take a special look at the people, including notable Art Center alumni, who inspired the selection of this stellar collection of vehicles. What inspires them? What challenges will future transportation designers face? And how is Art Center prepared to meet those challenges? " />

      <p style="padding-top:24px;">ArtCenter recently celebrated 90 years of design &mdash; from the 1924 Rolls Royce to the 2012 Fisker Karma &mdash; at Car Classic. The annual event, held Oct. 21, drew a crowd of 1,500 and featured colorful all-American classics, French Citroens, and a progression of cars built for speed, from a Corvette Stingray (designed by alums Pete Brock  and Larry Shindoa) to the 2011 McLaren (designed by alum Frank Stephenson).</p>
