        <p>Car Classic serves as a reminder that behind every beautifully designed car is an innovative and talented designer&mdash;one most likely educated at ArtCenter College of Design. For more than 10 years, ArtCenter&rsquo;s Car Classic event has examined automotive culture and vehicle architecture through the lens of design. More than just another high-profile car show, this popular public event celebrates the very best in automotive design, showcasing the College&rsquo;s strong ties to industry and honoring many of our noteworthy alumni.</p>
<p>Join us this year for &quot;Street to Screen&quot; as ArtCenter Car Classic explores the impact transportation and entertainment design has on Hollywood and the entertainment industry&mdash;on camera, on the road and behind the scenes. Transportation designers, car collectors, filmmakers and auto and lifestyle enthusiasts will converge at ArtCenter&rsquo;s annual event to hear from and meet the people who design the vehicles that we love to see cruising Sunset Boulevard, coasting along scenic byways or roaring to life on the big screen. </p>
<p>It's a daylong celebration, providing attendees an up-close-and-personal look at a carefully curated selection of innovative vehicles, rare automobiles and stunning concept cars.<br>
  <br>
  <strong>ArtCenter Car Classic. A concours event unlike any other.</strong><br>
