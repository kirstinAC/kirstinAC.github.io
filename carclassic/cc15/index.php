        <h2>ArtCenter Car Classic. <br />
A concours event unlike any other.</h2>
       
        
        <p>Car Classic serves as a reminder that behind every beautifully designed car is an innovative and talented designer&mdash;one most likely educated at ArtCenter College of Design. For more than 10 years, ArtCenter&rsquo;s Car Classic event has examined automotive culture and vehicle architecture through the lens of design. More than just another high-profile car show, this popular public event celebrates the very best in automotive design, showcasing the College&rsquo;s strong ties to industry and honoring many of our noteworthy alumni.</p>
        <p>This year, join transportation and entertainment designers, car collectors, pop culture enthusiasts and self-styled futurists to hear from and meet the people who design the vehicles we love and explore the many ways our quest for tomorrow has impacted our day-to-day lives. Whether it&rsquo;s yesterday&rsquo;s dream of the flying car, today&rsquo;s shared driving experience or tomorrow&rsquo;s autonomous vehicles, artists and designers have been depicting the future of transportation design&mdash;and bringing it to life&mdash;for generations. </p>
        <p>It's a daylong celebration, providing attendees an up-close-and-personal look at a carefully curated selection of innovative vehicles, rare automobiles and stunning concept cars.</p>
