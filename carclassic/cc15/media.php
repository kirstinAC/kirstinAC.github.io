        <h3>MEDIA CREDENTIALS</h3>
        <p>Since its inception, ArtCenter Car Classic has examined automotive culture and vehicle architecture through the lens of design. Today and moving forward, ArtCenter seeks to cultivate relationships with journalists who are not only interested in a vehicle&rsquo;s appearance and performance, but the individual behind the design&mdash;and ultimately the students who will become the designers of the future. As the College expands its curriculum to further impact the evolution of the mobility industry and the broader field of transportation, we are more than ever looking to collaborate with journalists interested in telling a compelling&mdash;and sometimes complex&mdash;ArtCenter story.</p>
        <p>This year&rsquo;s Car Classic provides several unique story opportunities, including:</p>
