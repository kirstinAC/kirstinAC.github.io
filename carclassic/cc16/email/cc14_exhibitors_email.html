<p>Dear Friend of ArtCenter Car Classic:</p>
<p><strong>We are extremely pleased to announce that Car Classic 2014</strong> will be returning to ArtCenter&rsquo;s Hillside Campus on Sunday, October 26, 2014, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s Car Classic, <em><strong>Street to Screen</strong></em>, will explore the impact that vehicle, transportation and entertainment design have had on Hollywood and the entertainment industry&mdash;both on camera and behind the scenes. Top transportation designers, car collectors, filmmakers and auto and lifestyle enthusiasts will converge at this high-profile event to hear from and meet the people who design the vehicles that we love to see cruising Sunset Boulevard, coasting along scenic byways or roaring to life on the big screen&mdash;or any screen.</p>
<p>As always, ArtCenter Car Classic 2014 is not a traditionally judged concours, but a celebration of design and designers that no other show offers: a carefully curated field of rare automobiles, surprising classics, stunning concept cars and innovative vehicles. Exhibited in ArtCenter&rsquo;s panoramic Sculpture Garden, Car Classic provides the perfect opportunity for exhibitors, attendees and ArtCenter&rsquo;s international students and alumni to experience the lasting impact of the creative process firsthand.</p>
<p>KABC Automotive Reporter Dave Kunz, Barry Meguiar, host of Discovery Channel&rsquo;s <em>Car Crazy</em>, and Motor Trend Radio&rsquo;s Ed Justice Jr. will once again emcee the event and awards ceremony. In our Meet the Designers program, ArtCenter alumnus Chip Foose will be joined by other notable designers whose richly imagined work has graced screens around the world. &ldquo;Stories Behind the Design&rqduo; interviews on the field with high-level designers and collectors give attendees a peek into designers&rsquo; minds throughout the day.</p>
