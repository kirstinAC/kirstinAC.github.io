    	<p>A  revised and clarified ArtCenter identity system was introduced in July 2015.</p>
    	<p>This identity takes elements that have been associated with ArtCenter over its 85-year history and remixes them in a way that provides flexibility in application and a strong and contemporary visual presence in print, in environmental applications and online. </p>
    	<p>The name of the college is written &ldquo;ArtCenter&rdquo; or &ldquo;ArtCenter College of Design&rdquo; with a capital &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;C&rdquo; and no space between Art and Center, in running text as well as when  the name stands alone. This more unique construction helps differentiate ArtCenter from other &ldquo;art centers&rdquo; and enables more relevant online search results, among other benefits.</p>
    	<p>Visually, the goal of the graphic identity is to communicate both the essential character of ArtCenter and the idea of design itself through the bold use of elemental form, color and typography.</p>
