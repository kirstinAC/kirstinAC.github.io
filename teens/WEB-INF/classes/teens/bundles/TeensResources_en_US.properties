<h3>This is your life. Do what you love, and do it often. </h3> \
<p>The Holstee Manifesto </p> \
<p>Given the daily demands of doing well in school and preparing for college, when was the last time you got to spend time focusing on your dreams? Granted, get-ting ready for life after high school is important. So is asking yourself if what you’re doing today will get you closer to where you’d like to be tomorrow.</p> \
<p>If you dream of becoming an artist or designer and know in your heart of hearts that this excites you, then begin your journey of self-discovery in ArtCenter for Teens. This journey depends upon creating, inventing, experimenting, taking risks, breaking rules, making mistakes and having fun. </p> \
<p>Classes in ArtCenter for Teens are designed to provide you with rich and meaningful experiences to apply art and design to master technical and conceptual skills, foster personal growth, and reach beyond the obvious. You’ll learn the ins and outs of the creative process—how to identify needs, frame problems, make choices, generate alternatives, work collaboratively and communicate your ideas with impact—all in a fun and creative learning environment. We’ll also challenge you to become a better risk-taker not only by playing to your strengths, but by strengthening your weaknesses. </p> \
<p>Our curriculum is rich and varied, conceived to help you become a better artist, designer and thinker. ArtCenter for Teens classes mirror the diverse disciplines of ArtCenter’s degree programs and reflect the College’s founding educational philosophy that a comprehensive art and design education is the foundation for successfully achieving both personal and professional goals. </p> \
<p>You’ll learn from a distinguished faculty of professional artists and designers who will share their personal stories, professional experiences and best practices with you. Our faculty will also engage you in discussions about career opportunities in art and design, mindful of sustainability and global issues and the role of artists and designers as agents of social change. </p> \
<p>Whether you’re just beginning or are at an advanced level, you’ll become part of a creative community dedicated to using art and design as catalysts to invent, motivate and challenge yourself and those around you. </p> \
<p>Are you ready to act on your dreams, fuel your passion and find your creative voice? If so, then ArtCenter for Teens is for you. </p> \

<p>Areas of concentration:<br/>Graphic Design/Advertising<br/>Entertainment Design<br/>Industrial Design (Product & Transportation Design)</p> \
<p>Tuition: $1,700.00</p> \
<p>For information about travel to Los Angeles and ArtCenter and accommodations, visit <a href="travel.jsp">Travel Info</a>.</p> \
<p>Please refer to <a href="policies.jsp">refund policy</a> for important deadlines.</p> <br/> \
<p><b><u>CLASS DESCRIPTIONS</u></b></p> \
<p><b>BRANDCAMP</b><br/> \
For students seeking an in-depth exposure to the advertising and graphic design industry, learn how to develop strong concepts that are the platform for a brand, while engaging in real-world design methodologies that empower you to execute your concepts to a high level of finish. You will develop your own strategic, graphic brand identity and a cross-media, integrated advertising campaign. </p> \
<p>This unique, dynamic and fun learning environment offers you a diverse blend of creative and strategic thinking, exposure to design process and theory, presentation techniques, critiques and discussions. There will also be industry field trips and guest speakers from prominent ad agencies and design firms.</p> \
<p>In addition to creating a strong portfolio piece and having an opportunity to acquire the skill set used in the industry, build your proficiency in concept development, research ability, design execution, presentation and collaboration. Estimated cost of materials: $50.00</p><br/> \
<p><b>ENTERTAINMENT DESIGN </b><br/> \
Whether it's the production of a movie, animation, video game or theme park, entertainment concept design serves as an integral part in the creative process. Concept designers intrigue audiences by realizing immersive, impactful and often times never-before-seen visuals to life. It not only requires great imagination but also an understanding of how things are built and of how to communicate these ideas to the people who will build these new worlds. </p> \
<p>Students will be introduced to Entertainment Design by learning all aspects of the design process, which includes designing and illustrating characters, environments, vehicles and props that the world has never seen before. Learn how to communicate through compelling drawings and expand your understanding of how things are built in 3-D. </p> \
<p>Presentation skills will be emphasized. A laptop, Photoshop, and drawing tablet are recommended. Estimated cost of materials: $60.00</p><br/> \
<p><b>INDUSTRIAL DESIGN </b>(Product & Transportation Design)<br/> \
Have you ever wondered how an iPhone reaches the store shelves from an initial napkin sketch? Are you constantly amazed at how all of the parts of your dream car work so well together in three dimensions? Behind each of these creations lies the field of Industrial Design, the crossroads of form (shape), human factors (ergonomics) and an understanding of engineering/manufacturing.</p> \
<p>Students will be introduced to Industrial Design through an intensive immersion into all aspects of the design process through lectures, in-class sketching, model-making and in-depth critique sessions. Presentation skills will be emphasized. Cross-disciplinary activities with the Graphics/Advertising and Entertainment students will enhance your experience by simulating working in a design consultancy.</p> \
<p>A camera (point and shoot, DSLR, or a quality cellphone) will be required for documentation and composition exercises. A laptop or an iPad/tablet is recommended for research and presentations in class. Estimated cost of materials: $70.00</p><br/>
