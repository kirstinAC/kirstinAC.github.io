				<h2>How to Drop a Class</h2> 
				<p>You may submit a request to drop a class online by <a href="javascript:;" id="add_drop_link" class="cboxElement">logging in</a> to your ArtCenter for Teens account. You may also submit a written request to drop a class. To do this, pick up and complete a Change of Program form at the ArtCenter for Teens office, or fax a signed note to 626 396.4219. It is your responsibility to follow up by calling 626 396.2319 to confirm that your fax was received and that it is legible. Failure to drop a class officially can result in a grade of F for that class. </p> 
				<p>Written or faxed requests to drop any or all classes must include the following: </p> 
				<ul> 
					<li>Your full name</li> 
					<li>Your student ID and address</li>

					<li>Your signature</li> 
				</ul> 
				<p>Please note: We cannot process faxed or in-person drop requests on Saturdays, Sundays or campus holidays when the Public Programs office is closed.</p>

				<h2>Class Changes and Cancellations </h2> 
				<p>ArtCenter reserves the right to cancel any class, limit class size, change times or substitute instructors for those listed in the class schedule as it deems necessary.
