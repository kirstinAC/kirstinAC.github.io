        <p>From <em>Coachbuilding</em> to <em>Supercars</em> to <em>Freedom of Motion</em>, ArtCenter has showcased a dynamic array of vehicles, planes, bikes and boats throughout the years. Unlike other car shows, Car Classic has always celebrated vehicle design and the designers behind them. </p>

<p>In keeping with this year&rsquo;s theme, <em>Inspired by Nature</em>, we will be showcasing vehicles from classic to modern to concept cars and other forms of mobility to delve into how everyday examples of nature inspire transportation design&mdash;in sculpture and form, natural composites, and the fluidity to move through water and air. </p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve reached out to our global alumni network, in addition to car collectors and leaders in transportation design, and now have a specific list of vehicles we&rsquo;re looking for. Chances are you have what we need&mdash;and we intend to make room for a few notable additions as well. </p>

<p>If you have a car or vehicle you&rsquo;d like to exhibit, please submit the <a href="pdf/2013_CC_Exhibitor_Appilcation.pdf">exhibitor application form</a>.</p>
