        <p>Car Classic serves as a reminder that behind every beautifully designed car is an innovative and talented designer&mdash;one most likely educated at ArtCenter College of Design. For more than a decade, ArtCenter&rsquo;s Car Classic event has examined automotive culture and vehicle architecture through the lens of design. More than just another high-profile car show, this popular public event celebrates the very best in automotive design, showcasing the College&rsquo;s strong ties to industry and honoring many of our noteworthy alumni.<br>
          <br>
          This year, we celebrate handcrafted vehicles from the past and present and will hear from the people who build and collect them. Nothing can replace the human touch in creating works of amazing beauty and design. Even in this digital age, skilled makers combine traditions of the past with future technologies to produce truly exceptional results.<br>
          <br>
        Join auto enthusiasts, art aficionados, tinkerers, builders and weekend adventurers at ArtCenter College of Design for a daylong celebration, providing attendees an up-close-and-personal look at a carefully curated selection of rare and unique coach built classics, hot rods, custom cars and futuristic concepts.<!-- <p><a href="http://engage.artcenter.edu/carclassic2016" class="button" target="_blank">General Admission</a><br />
