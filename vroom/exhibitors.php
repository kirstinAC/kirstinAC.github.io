        <p>ArtCenter Car Classic 2017 will be held on Sunday, October 22, 2017 from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. at ArtCenter College of Design in Pasadena, California.</p>

<p>We welcome exhibitors with vehicles from all eras&ndash;classic to modern to concept&ndash;that represent the finest examples of automotive design, particularly those representing the best of Italian, American or French design. <a href="http://www.artcenter.edu/assets/9007/src/CC17_Exhibitor_Form.pdf" target=newwindow>Download the Exhibitor Form</a>. </p>

<p>The ArtCenter Car Classic 2017 Selection Committee will select vehicles for exhibition from all applications received. Vehicles that have not been exhibited in the last two Car Classic events are preferred. You are welcome to enter more than one vehicle (please submit a separate application for each vehicle). Due to our limited space we are unable to accept all the truly beautiful and deserving entries. We appreciate your understanding.</p>

<p>Please complete the exhibitor application, and return it with photograph(s) of your vehicle(s) along with a brief description of each vehicles&#8217; background, including such things as how your vehicle relates to the theme &quot;Red, White and Blue: Celebrating Italian, American and French Design.&quot; If you&#8217;re submitting a classic, sports or exotic vehicle, what is the design story? What technical or design innovations appear on your vehicle? What inspired the design? </p>

<p>Entry forms and photograph(s) can be sent via email or by mail (see below). Applicants will be notified within 10 working days of their status, upon review of the Selection Committee. </p>

<p>Applicants selected for exhibition will receive one complimentary General Admission ticket to the event. In lieu of an exhibitor fee, entrants are encouraged to enhance their experience through a range of attractive meal options and patron opportunities. In addition to a tax-deductible donation, patrons enjoy exclusive access to the judges breakfast, access to VIP parking and special recognition. Net proceeds from the event will go toward supporting student scholarships for our next generation of designers.
